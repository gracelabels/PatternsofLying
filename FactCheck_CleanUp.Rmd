FactCheck.Org does not have an ordered tier based rating system like PolitiFact and the Washington Post. Rather they have list of descriptive ratings they more commonly assign to claims. FactCheck.Org only publishes claims they find to have some level of false information. Their assesments are decriptive of the nature of the falsehood rather than assessing the level of false information. 

The most common ratings are as follows 

Unsupported
Spins the Facts
Out of Context
Not the Whole Story
No Evidence
Misleading
FALSE
Exaggerates
Distorts the Facts
Cherry Picks
